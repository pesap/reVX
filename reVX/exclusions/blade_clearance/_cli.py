    """Exclude regions where system blade clearance does not meet requirements.

    Blade clearance restrictions can be computed from a generic minimum
    blade clearance requirement, from local regulations, or from both.
    When both are supplied, local regulations override the generic
    result inside their jurisdictions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    excl_fpath : str
        Path to HDF5 file containing output layer profile information.
        If you are providing a ``regulations_fpath`` input that is not a
        GeoPackage, this HDF5 file should also contain a county FIPS
        layer (called ``cnty_fips``) used to match local regulations in
        ``regulations_fpath`` to counties on the grid. No data will be
        written to this file unless explicitly requested via the
        ``out_layers`` input.
    out_dir : str
        Path to output directory where output file should be written.
    regulations_fpath : str, optional
        Path to regulations ``.csv`` or ``.gpkg`` file. At a minimum,
        this file must contain the following columns:

            - ``Feature Type``: Contains labels for the type of
              restriction that each row represents. To compute blade
              clearance exclusions, at least one row must have the value
              "Blade Clearance" in this column (case-insensitive and
              ignoring dashes and underscores).
            - ``Feature Subtype``: Contains labels for feature subtypes.
              For blade clearance exclusion computations, you should
              leave this blank or set it to ``None``.
            - ``Value Type``: Specifies the units of the value in the
              ``Value`` column. For blade clearance exclusion
              computations, the value type must be "meters", "percent",
              or "percent of tower height" (case-insensitive).
            - ``Value``: Numeric value of the blade clearance
              restriction.
            - ``FIPS``: Specifies a unique 5-digit code for each county
              (this can be an integer - no leading zeros required). This
              is used along side the ``cnty_fips`` layer in the
              `excl_fpath` to match the county regulations to the
              county's spatial extent.

    hub_height : float | int
        Turbine hub height (m), used along with rotor diameter to
        compute blade clearance.
    rotor_diameter : float | int
        Turbine rotor diameter (m), used along with hub height to
        compute blade clearance.
    generic_minimum_clearance : float | int, optional
        Generic minimum blade clearance requirement in meters to apply
        everywhere outside jurisdictions with local regulations. By
        default, ``None``.
    replace : bool, optional
        Flag to replace the output GeoTIFF if it already exists.
        By default, ``False``.
    hsds : bool, optional
        Boolean flag to use ``h5pyd`` to handle HDF5 "files" hosted on
        AWS behind HSDS. By default, ``False``.
    out_layers : dict, optional
        Dictionary mapping the input feature file names (with extension)
        to names of layers under which exclusions should be saved in the
        ``excl_fpath`` HDF5 file. If ``None`` or empty dictionary,
        no layers are saved to the HDF5 file. By default, ``None``.
    max_workers : int, optional
        Number of workers to use for exclusion computation. If this
        value is 1, the computation runs in serial. If this value
        is > 1, the computation runs in parallel with that many workers.
        If ``None``, the computation runs in parallel on all available
        cores. By default, ``None``.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        Path to output GeoTIFF file containing exclusion data.
