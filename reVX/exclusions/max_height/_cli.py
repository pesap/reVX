    """Exclude regions where system height exceeds height limits.

    Exclusions can be computed for a specific turbine (hub height and
    rotor diameter) or more generally using a system height.

    Height restrictions can be computed from a generic maximum allowed
    system height, from local regulations, or from both. When both are
    supplied, local regulations override the generic result inside
    their jurisdictions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    excl_fpath : str
        Path to HDF5 file containing output layer profile information.
        If you are providing a ``regulations_fpath`` input that is not a
        GeoPackage, this HDF5 file should also contain a county FIPS
        layer (called ``cnty_fips``) used to match local regulations in
        ``regulations_fpath`` to counties on the grid. No data will be
        written to this file unless explicitly requested via the
        ``out_layers`` input.
    out_dir : str
        Path to output directory where output file should be written.
    regulations_fpath : str, optional
        Path to regulations ``.csv`` or ``.gpkg`` file. At a minimum,
        this file must contain the following columns:

            - ``Feature Type``: Contains labels for the type of
              restriction that each row represents. To compute height
              exclusions, at least one row must have the value
              "Maximum Height" or "Maximum Turbine Height" in this
              column (case-insensitive and ignoring dashes and
              underscores).
            - ``Feature Subtype``: Contains labels for feature subtypes.
              For height exclusion computations, you should leave this
              blank or set it to ``None``.
            - ``Value Type``: Specifies the units of the value in the
              ``Value`` column. For height exclusion computations, the
              value type must be "meters" (case-insensitive).
            - ``Value``: Numeric value of the height restriction.
            - ``FIPS``: Specifies a unique 5-digit code for each county
              (this can be an integer - no leading zeros required). This
              is used along side the ``cnty_fips`` layer in the
              `excl_fpath` to match the county regulations to the
              county's spatial extent.

    system_height : float | int, optional
       Height of the system being considered. If this input is not
       ``None``, then ``hub_height`` and ``rotor_diameter`` must both be
       ``None``. By default, `None`.
    hub_height : float | int, optional
        Turbine hub height (m), used along with rotor diameter to
        compute blade tip-height which is used as the system height.
        By default, ``None``.
    rotor_diameter : float | int, optional
        Turbine rotor diameter (m), used along with hub height to
        compute blade tip-height which is used as the system height.
        By default, ``None``.
    generic_height_limit : float | int, optional
        Generic maximum allowed system height in meters to apply
        everywhere outside jurisdictions with local regulations. By
        default, ``None``.
    replace : bool, optional
        Flag to replace the output GeoTIFF if it already exists.
        By default, ``False``.
    hsds : bool, optional
        Boolean flag to use ``h5pyd`` to handle HDF5 "files" hosted on
        AWS behind HSDS. By default, ``False``.
    out_layers : dict, optional
        Dictionary mapping the input feature file names (with extension)
        to names of layers under which exclusions should be saved in the
        ``excl_fpath`` HDF5 file. If ``None`` or empty dictionary,
        no layers are saved to the HDF5 file. By default, ``None``.
    max_workers : int, optional
        Number of workers to use for exclusion computation. If this
        value is 1, the computation runs in serial. If this value
        is > 1, the computation runs in parallel with that many workers.
        If ``None``, the computation runs in parallel on all available
        cores. By default, ``None``.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        Path to output GeoTIFF file containing exclusion data.
